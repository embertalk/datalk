# Whenever you change Exim's configuration file, you *must* remember #
# to HUP the Exim daemon, because it will not pick up the new        #
# configuration until you do. However, any other Exim processes that #
# are started, for example, a process started by an MUA in order to  #
# send a message, will see the new configuration as soon as it is in #
# place.                                                             #

# You do not need to HUP the daemon for changes in auxiliary files   #
# that are referenced from this file. They are read every time they  #
# are used.                                                          #

# It is usually a good idea to test a new configuration for          #
# syntactic correctness before installing it (for example, by        #
# running the command "exim -C /config/file.new -bV").               #

# If you want to accept mail addressed to your host's literal IP address, for

# OPTIONAL MODIFICATIONS:
#  These defaults work for us; you may wish to uncomment the line 
#  below and change the allow_domain_literals line below to true
#  to allow domain literals in your environment

# local_domains_include_host_literals

# The following line prevents Exim from recognizing addresses of the form
# "user@[111.111.111.111]" that is, with a "domain literal" (an IP address)
# instead of a named domain. The RFCs still require this form, but it makes
# little sense to permit mail to be sent to specific hosts by their IP address
# in the modern Internet, and this ancient format has been used by those
# seeking to abuse hosts by using them for unwanted relaying. If you really
# do want to support domain literals, remove the following line, and see
# also the "domain_literal" router below.

# No local deliveries will ever be run under the uids of these users (a colon-
# separated list). An attempt to do so gets changed so that it runs under the
# uid of "nobody" instead. This is a paranoic safety catch. Note the default
# setting means you cannot deliver mail addressed to root as if it were a
# normal user. This isn't usually a problem, as most sites have an alias for
# root that redirects such mail to a human administrator.

never_users = root

# DO HOST LOOKUP
# OPTIONAL MODIFICATIONS:
# The setting below causes Exim to do a reverse DNS lookup on all incoming
# IP calls, in order to get the true host name. If you feel this is too
# expensive, you can specify the networks for which a lookup is done, or
# remove the setting entirely.

# DISALLOW IDENT CALLBACKS
# OPTIONAL MODIFICATIONS:
# Exim may be set to make RFC 1413 (ident) callbacks for all incoming SMTP
# calls. You can limit the hosts to which these calls are made, and/or change
# the timeout that is used. If you set the timeout to zero, all RFC 1413 calls
# are disabled. RFC 1413 calls are cheap and can provide useful information
# for tracing problem messages, but some hosts and firewalls have problems
# with them. This can result in a timeout instead of an immediate refused
# connection, leading to delays on starting up an SMTP session.  By default
# we disable callbacks for incoming SMTP calls.  You may change
# rfc1413_query_timeout to 30s or some other positive number of seconds to
# enable callbacks for incoming SMTP calls.

rfc1413_hosts = *
rfc1413_query_timeout = 0s

# BOUNCE MESSAGES
# OPTIONAL MODIFICATIONS:
# When Exim can neither deliver a message nor return it to sender, it
# "freezes" the delivery error message (aka "bounce message"). There are also
# other circumstances in which messages get frozen. They will stay on the
# queue forever unless one or both of the following options is set.

# This option unfreezes bounce messages after two days, tries
# once more to deliver them, and ignores any delivery failures.
